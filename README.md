You will need _gtkmm_ and _Gtkmm-PLplot_ in order to build.

To install gtkmm on linux try this:

`sudo apt install libgtkmm-3.0-dev`

If it does not work, check out the _Installation_ section of the gtkmm documentation.

In order to install Gtkmm-PLplot, follow the _Installation instructions_ section of it's documentation. It has packages for various linux distros.
