# Kalman filter demo

A demo application for the one-dimensional case of the _Kalman filter_ algorithm written in C++, having a user-interface using _gtk_, following the _solid_ principles, and incorporating unit tests.

To execute the tests without the ignored and the sporadic tests (random tests) execute the Tests module with the following arguments:

`~[ignore]~[random-test]`

You will need _gtkmm_ and _Gtkmm-PLplot_ in order to build.

To install gtkmm on linux try this:

`sudo apt install libgtkmm-3.0-dev`

If it does not work, check out the _Installation_ section of the gtkmm documentation.

In order to install Gtkmm-PLplot, follow the _Installation instructions_ section of it's documentation. It has packages for various linux distros.
