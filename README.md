# Kalman filter demo

A demo application for the one-dimensional case of the _Kalman filter_ algorithm written in C++, having a user-interface using _gtk_, following the _solid_ principles, and incorporating unit tests.

You will need the _gtkmm_ library in order to build. On linux try this:

`sudo apt install libgtkmm-3.0-dev`

If it does not work, then check out the _Installation_ section of the official gtkmm documentation.
